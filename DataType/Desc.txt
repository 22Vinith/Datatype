JavaScript has several data types that can be categorized into two main groups: primitive and reference types.

1. Primitive Data Types
Primitive data types are immutable and represent a single value. JavaScript includes the following primitive types:

Number: Represents both integer and floating-point numbers.
String: Represents a sequence of characters.
Boolean: Represents a logical entity, with values true or false.
Undefined: Indicates a variable that has been declared but not assigned a value.
Null: Represents the intentional absence of any object value.
Symbol: A unique and immutable value, often used as object property keys.
BigInt: Represents whole numbers larger than the maximum safe integer limit and allows for arbitrary precision.

2. Reference Data Types
Reference types are more complex and can hold collections of values or entities. The main reference types in JavaScript are:

Object: A collection of key-value pairs that can store various data types.
Array: A special type of object used to store ordered collections of values.
Function: A callable object that can be assigned to variables and passed as arguments.
