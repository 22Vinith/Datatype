Feature         	Regular Function	                                        Arrow Function
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Syntax            	Uses function keyword, more verbose	                  More concise, uses => syntax
this Binding	    Dynamic, based on how the function is calle           Lexically bound to the context where it's defined
Constructor	        Can be used as a constructor (new keyword)	          Cannot be used as a constructor (new will throw an error)
 Object	            Has access to the arguments object	                  No arguments object, can use rest parameters (...args)
Use in Methods	    Binds this to the object when used as a method	      Inherits this from the surrounding context (not the object)
Return Statements	Requires return keyword for multi-line code   	      Implicit return for single-line expressions
Hoisting	        Hoisted to the top of their scope	                  Not hoisted, must be defined before use
