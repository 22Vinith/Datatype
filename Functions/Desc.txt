Functions in JavaScript are fundamental constructs used to encapsulate reusable blocks of code that can be executed when called. They enable developers to organize code, facilitate code reuse, and manage complexity. Hereâ€™s a detailed description:

Definition and Purpose
A function is a set of instructions designed to perform a specific task. Functions allow you to define code once and execute it multiple times throughout your program, making your code more modular and manageable.

Types of Functions
Function Declarations: Defined using the function keyword and can be hoisted, allowing them to be called before their definition in the code.

Function Expressions: Functions defined as part of an expression, typically assigned to a variable. They are not hoisted.

Arrow Functions: A concise syntax introduced in ES6 that provides a more streamlined way to write functions. They do not have their own this context.

Immediately Invoked Function Expressions (IIFE): Functions that are executed immediately after they are defined, often used to create a new scope.

Parameters and Arguments
Functions can accept parameters (variables in the function definition) and receive arguments (values passed to the function). You can also set default values for parameters.

Return Values
Functions can return values using the return statement. If no return statement is provided, the function returns undefined.
