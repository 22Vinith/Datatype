In JavaScript, scope defines the accessibility of variables, functions, and objects at different parts of a program. 
It determines where in the code a particular variable or function can be referenced or used. 
The key types of scope in JavaScript are:

1. Global Scope:
Variables or functions declared in the global scope are accessible from anywhere in the program. 
Global scope refers to the top-level scope, outside of any function or block, and variables declared in this scope become properties of the global object (e.g., window in browsers). 
Overuse of global variables can lead to naming conflicts and unintended side effects.

2. Function Scope:
Function scope is specific to variables or functions declared within a function. 
They are only accessible within that function, and not outside of it. 
This scope ensures encapsulation, allowing variables to be used without polluting the global scope. 
Function-scoped variables are isolated to the function in which they are defined, making them inaccessible once the function execution completes.

3. Block Scope:
Variables declared within a block of code (such as loops or conditionals) are limited to that block, 
provided they are declared using let or const. 
Block scope helps in controlling variable lifecycles more precisely. 
It restricts the visibility of variables to the block where they are declared, ensuring that they cannot be accessed outside of that block. 
Variables declared with var are not block-scoped and are instead function-scoped.
